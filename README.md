# Newman with htmlextra report Docker Image

## Description

This docker image is based on the original `newman` image from [postmanlabs](https://github.com/postmanlabs/newman).  
It's extended with the additional report `newman-reporter-htmlextra` via this [npm package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/newman-reporter-htmlextra). Just run your newman command with the option `-r htmlextra`.
